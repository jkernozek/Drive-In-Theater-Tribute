    <h1>A Little Tribute to Drive-In Theaters</h1>
    <img class="mainimg" src="./assets/images/drive-in.jpg" width="100%" />
    <p>
      Drive-in movie theaters have this perfect mix of nostalgia, fresh air, and
      flickering light. It's a simple idea—watching a film from your car—but
      somehow it feels more like an event than just “going to the movies.”
    </p>

    <h2>What Is a Drive-In Theater?</h2>
    <p>
      A drive-in theater is an outdoor movie theater where you park your car in
      front of a huge screen, tune in to the sound (through a speaker or your
      car radio), and watch the movie under the open sky. You’ve got your own
      space, your own snacks, and a whole lot of atmosphere.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Drive-Ins Are Special</h2>
    <h3>Here's what makes drive-ins feel different from a regular theater:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can bring your own blankets, pillows, and snacks.</li>
      <li>
        The sky, the weather, and the surroundings become part of the
        experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        It feels more relaxed—talk quietly, stretch out, sit outside if you
        want.
      </li>
      <li>
        There's a sense of old-school charm you just don't get in a modern
        multiplex.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Perfect Drive-In Night</h2>
    <h3>
      If I could design the perfect drive-in evening, it would probably look
      like this:
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Arrive before sunset to get a good spot and watch the sky change colors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up a cozy spot with a blanket, camp chairs, and a small cooler.
      </li>
      <li>Grab something warm to eat—chili, popcorn, or a good burger.</li>
      <li>
        Turn up the sound, roll the windows down just a bit, and get lost in the
        movie.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drive home in the dark with that quiet, satisfied feeling after a good
        story.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why This Page Exists</h2>
    <p>
      This is a small tribute to a simple idea that still feels magical:
      watching a movie with other people, out in the open, under the night sky.
      Drive-ins are part movie, part memory machine—and I hope they stick around
      for a long time.
    </p>
